    "This sprint, our team applied **Agile methodology** to collaboratively build our Solitaire game.  \n",
    "Instead of trying to finish everything in one go, we worked in **short iterations**—building a feature, testing it, and refining it based on feedback.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Agile Manifesto emphasizes **collaboration, responding to change, and working software over documentation**. Our process reflected that: each member took on a role and contributed through frequent commits, peer reviews, and shared debugging sessions.\n",

    "**Frequent Feedback Loops:** Instead of waiting until the end, feedback came early. This helped us spot design flaws quickly and adapt our plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Shared Ownership:** By doing pair reviews and joint commits, I learned how different coding styles can be merged into one consistent project.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Iterative Mindset:** I realized that Agile is about building usable versions often, then refining them through collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, collaboration shifted my approach from “working alone on a perfect product” to “building together, learning from mistakes, and improving step by step.” This mindset will help me in future LxD projects because feedback and iteration are at the core of designing meaningful learning experiences."
