    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This year’s setup process was smoother because I already had most of my tools configured from last year. I was already familiar with **GitHub, VSCode, and WSL**, and I had previously worked with Linux commands for installing dependencies and managing repositories. The main update was moving to **WSL Ubuntu 24.04** (from 22.04), which went smoothly thanks to my prior experience.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The most important change in workflow this year was how we connected to the course repository. Instead of using the **OCS repository as a template** like last year, we had to **fork from the upstream OCS repo** and then clone our fork. This ensures that we can pull updates from upstream while still having our own repository for commits and customization. Once I made this adjustment, the GitHub integration with VSCode worked as expected.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I verified that the setup worked by running the **Makefile**, confirming my environment builds properly and that my site runs both on **localhost** and when deployed to **GitHub Pages**.\n",

Forking allows me to pull updates from the teacher’s repository, which keeps my work synced and prevents me from falling behind.  \n",
