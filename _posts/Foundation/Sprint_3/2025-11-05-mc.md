I learnt many valuable skills while taking this College Board Practice MC Exam, including:

- Time management during the test (to not get stuck on any problem for too long)
- Code analysis in segments
- Drawing maps of loops and operations

On this MC, I earned a **32/42**. My analytics are as follows:

After viewing my score, I checked the topic breakdowns to determine which big ideas I need to work on the most. My mistakes mainly centered in the class creation big idea, which is reflected in my topic breakdowns as well.

<h2><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#94eaff"> Mistakes and Corrections </span></h2>

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 9 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/9.png">

**Selected:** ```The variables feet and inches cannot be accessed from the method toInches.```

**Correct:** ```The toInches method cannot be accessed from a class other than Measurement.```

I got this question wrong because I did not understand what .

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 13 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/13.png">

**Selected:** ```20```

**Correct:** ```25```

I got this question wrong because while I correctly identified that the outer loop was run 5 times, I incorrectly thought that the inner loop ran 4 times. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 19 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/19.png">

**Selected:** ```It generates a random integer between 10 and 16,  inclusive, and assigns it to r.```

**Correct:** ```It generates a random integer between 10 and 15,  inclusive, and assigns it to r.```

When I answered this question, I learned that Math.random only generates numbers between 0 and 1. However, I forgot to note that 1 is not inclusive, so 16 is not a possibility of this statement. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 22 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/22.png">

**Selected:** ```The instance variables should be designated public instead of  private.```

**Correct:** ```The  getInfo  method does not have access to variables named  pName  or  pSpecies.```

I got this question wrong because I misunderstood the difference between private and public variables. That was not the issue here; the issue lay in the getInfo method instead. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 26 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/26.png">

**Selected:** ```In line 3, changing the statement  n /= 10  to  n %= 10```

**Correct:** ```In line 1, changing the condition  n > 0  to  n / 10 > 0```

I got this question wrong because I did not realize that the answer choice I selected would lead to an infinite loop. I should slow down when answering operator questions.

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 34 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/34.png">

**Selected:** 
```java
for (int j = 0; j < oldList.size(); j++)
{
   newList.add(oldList.get(0));
   newList.add(oldList.get(j)); 
}
```

**Correct:** 
```java
for (String s : oldList)
{
   newList.add(s);
   newList.add(0, s); 
}
```
While I do understand how indexing in Java works, I seem to have forgotten during this question :(

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 35 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/35.png">

**Selected:** ```It returns  true  if  numbers  is sorted from least to greatest and returns  false  otherwise.```

**Correct:** ```It returns  true  if  numbers  is sorted from greatest to least and returns  false  otherwise.```

I got this question wrong because I did not read the answer choices carefully. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 40 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/40.png">

**Selected:** ```[10, 30, 60, 20, 50, 40]```

**Correct:** ```[10, 20, 30, 60, 50, 40]```

I only calculated 2 iterations of the loop instead of 3 as the question asked. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 41 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/41.png">

**Selected:** ```3```

**Correct:** ```5```

I assigned J to result as opposed to K, which caused the final index to be wrong. 

<h4><span style="font-family: Tahoma; color:#e194ff"> Question 42 </span></h4>

<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/00_rg_imgs/sprint3/42.png">

**Selected:** 
```java
int sum = 0;
for (int j = 0; j <= 5; j++)
{
   j++;
   sum += j;
}
```
**Correct:** 
```java
int sum = 0;
for (int j = 1; j <= 6; j++)
{
   sum += j;
}
```

I miscalculated the original sum, causing me to select the wrong answer. 

## Overall Reflection

I need to work on identifying where errors originate in code. Furthermore, many of my errors stemmed from simple mistakes and logical errors, which gives me confidence that if I take the test earlier in the day, I will be able to earn a higher score.
