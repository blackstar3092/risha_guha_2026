# Compound Assignment Operators (AP CS A, Unit 1.6)


## What Are They, and What Do They Help With?
##### A **compound assignment operator** combines an arithmetic (or other) operation with an assignment in one statement.  

**For example, instead of writing:**
```java
score = score + 10;
```
**You can write:**
```java
score += 10;
```
## Learning Goals For End of Lesson
By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to:
- Transform clunky `x = x + y` statements into sleek compound assignments
- Master all the essential operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `++`, `--`)
- Understand evaluation order and avoid common traps


## Table of Different Operations in Java

| Operator | Equivalent Full Form | Purpose / Typical Use |
|----------|---------------------|----------------------|
| `+=`     | `x = x + y`         | Add to a running total; accumulate; string concatenation when LHS is a String. |
| `-=`     | `x = x - y`         | Subtract / reduce something (e.g. subtract a cost, penalty). |
| `*=`     | `x = x * y`         | Multiply — useful for scaling, growth, repeated doubling or factors. |
| `/=`     | `x = x / y`         | Divide — scaling down; used in averages, proportions. (Watch out: integer division if both operands are ints.) |
| `%=`     | `x = x % y`         | Remainder after division — wrap-around logic, parity checks, keeping things within bounds. |
| `++`     | `x = x + 1`         | Add one; often used in loops, counters. |
| `--`     | `x = x - 1`         | Subtract one; used in loops as well as decrementing counters. |

## Popcorn Hack #1: 
Transform this beginner code into more advanced code using compound assignment operators.


```java
int playerScore = 1000;
int playerHealth = 100;
int enemiesDefeated = 0;

// Player defeats an enemy worth 250 points
playerScore = playerScore + 250;

// Player takes 15 damage
playerHealth = playerHealth - 15;

// Enemy count goes up
enemiesDefeated = enemiesDefeated + 1;

// Boss battle: double the current score!
playerScore = playerScore * 2;

// Healing potion restores health to 80% of current
playerHealth = playerHealth * 4;
playerHealth = playerHealth / 5;  // 4/5 = 0.8, but we need integer math
```

### Examples to further understand this concept:


```java
public class Example {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int score = 100;
    double average = 85.5;
    score += 50;       // score = 150
    score -= 25;       // score = 125
    score *= 2;        // score = 250
    score /= 5;        // score = 50  (integer division)
    score %= 15;       // score = 5   (50 % 15)
    average += 4.5;    // average = 90.0
    int count = 0;
    count++;           // count = 1
    count--;
    System.out.println(count); // count = 0
  }
}
Example.main(null);

// Output: 0
// Output: 0 
// Explanation: The code demonstrates various assignment and arithmetic operations, including integer division and the modulus operator. The final output is 0 after incrementing and decrementing the count variable.
```

## Popcorn Hack #2: 
Write a short program where a variable called ```score``` starts at 100. Use at least three different compound assignment operators to update score, and print the result after each step.

Example goals to try:
1. Deduct points for a wrong answer (```-=```)
2. Double the score with a power-up (```*=```)
3. Find remainder after dividing by 7 (```%=```)

### Important Rules to keep in mind (AP Test-Specific):
1. You can only use these when the variable on the left already exists and has a value.

2. Integer division: when you divide two ints, the fractional part is truncated. Be careful with ```/=```.

3. Only post-form (```x++```, ```x--```) is in scope for the AP exam. Prefix forms (++x) are out of scope.

# Homework Assignment for Unit 1.6

## Assignment Overview

Now that you've learned about compound assignment operators, it's time to put them into practice! You'll create a short Java program that models a real-world scenario.

## Requirements

Your program must include:
- **At least 3 different** compound assignment operators (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, `++`, `--`)
- **Meaningful variable names** that make sense for your chosen scenario
- **Print statements** showing the value after each operation
- **Comments** explaining what each operation represents in your scenario
- A **main method** that runs your simulation

---

## Scenario Options

Choose **ONE** of the following scenarios to model:

### **Option A: Social Media Influencer Simulator**
Model the journey of a content creator tracking their growth:

##### **Suggested variables to track:**
- `followers` - Start with some initial followers
- `posts` - Number of posts made
- `engagement` - Likes/comments received
- `sponsorshipEarnings` - Money earned from sponsors

##### **Example operations you might use:**
- Gain followers from a viral post (`followers += 1000`)
- Lose followers from controversial content (`followers -= 50`)
- Double engagement from a trending hashtag (`engagement *= 2`)
- Calculate average engagement per post (`engagement /= posts`)
- Find your ranking position (`position %= 100`)


### **Option B: Bank Account Manager**
Simulate managing a personal bank account over time:

##### **Suggested variables to track:**
- `balance` - Current account balance
- `transactions` - Number of transactions made
- `monthlyFee` - Account maintenance costs
- `interestRate` - Interest earned/applied

##### **Example operations you might use:**
- Add monthly salary (`balance += 3000`)
- Subtract rent payment (`balance -= 1200`)
- Apply interest rate (`balance *= 1.02`)
- Average monthly spending (`spending /= 12`)
- Check account tier eligibility (`tier %= 5`)

### **Option C: Fitness Progress Tracker** 
Track your fitness journey and daily health metrics:

##### **Suggested variables to track:**
- `totalCalories` - Calories consumed/burned
- `workoutDays` - Days you've exercised
- `stepCount` - Daily step count
- `weightGoal` - Target weight progress

##### **Example operations you might use:**
- Add calories from meals (`totalCalories += 600`)
- Burn calories from exercise (`totalCalories -= 300`)
- Double steps from an active day (`stepCount *= 2`)
- Calculate average daily steps (`stepCount /= 7`)
- Track weekly goal progress (`progress %= 7`)


---
## Sample Output Format

Your program should produce an output similar to this (**this is an example for Option A but the format for other options is similar**):

```
=== SOCIAL MEDIA SIMULATOR ===

Starting followers: 500

Posted a new video!

Followers: 750 (+250 from the viral video)

Controversial opinion posted...

Followers: 700 (-50 from upset followers)

Trending hashtag boost!

Followers: 1400 (doubled from trending!)

Average engagement per post: 35

Final ranking position: 400

=== SIMULATION COMPLETE ===
```
